# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features two paddles and a ball, with basic collision detection and scoring mechanisms. The game ends when you close the window.

## Features

- **Two Paddles**: Controlled by keyboard inputs.
- **Ball**: Moves across the screen and bounces off paddles.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks and displays the score.
- **Collision Detection**: Ball bounces off paddles and resets when it passes either paddle.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This game is built using Python's `turtle` module, which comes pre-installed with Python.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pong-game.git
   cd pong-game


## Ensure all required modules are available:

The necessary modules (turtle, time) are part of Pythonâ€™s standard library, so no additional installation is needed.

## How to Play
**Right Paddle (Player 1):**
- Move Up: Press the Up arrow key.
- Move Down: Press the Down arrow key.

**Left Paddle (Player 2):**
- Move Up: Press the W key.
- Move Down: Press the S key.

The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and prevent it from passing your side. If the ball passes your paddle, the opponent scores a point.
